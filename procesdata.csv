96,Zirve,2023,0,8,1,"Everyone wants to reach the top. Some climb the steps one by one, while some smash their way forward. But others have only one goal; and that is to go To the Top and watch the losers beneath. Candas wanted to rise To the Top by crushing others. He cheated on his wife Ozden, and left behind most of the businesses he started and operated with great confidence. He wanted to be in his best form in a relationship hence he took Ferzin with him. On the other hand, Ferzin's mind and dreams were very completely different. She blended her passion and hatred with the flame inside her day by day. She was already above everyone else. Her goal was to reach the Summit. Maybe just because of this, Ferzin accepted Candas's plan and decided to decieve her son's brother's mother, Candas's ex-wife Ozden.

304,Kanit,2010,2013,100,3,"""Kanit"" is a hundred-episode criminal series that aired on Kanal D between 2010 and 2013. In each episode, police detectives Orhan and Selim try and solve puzzling cases with the help of forensic experts. However, the distinctive style of Kanit sets it apart from typical detective dramas by being closer to reality. Professor Sevil Atasoy, a forensic scientist, narrates the show. She occasionally chimes in and shares information about the ongoing case, a newly found evidence, or the science of criminology itself while telling eye-opening anecdotes from the criminal history. Also ""There is no perfect murder."" is her motto and is the last told sentence in many episodes of Kanit.",tt2151208,"['Sevil Atasoy', 'Engin Benli', 'Deniz Celiloglu']",['Turkey'],['Turkish'],['ANS Production'],"['Crime', 'Drama']",TVSeries,[],4500,2010-07-08,"In each episode, detectives Orhan and Selim attempt to solve puzzling cases with the help and guidance of forensics.

509,Son,2012,2013,25,1,"IRAN - the near future. Aylin, a beautiful but beaten Turkish woman, is being held captive. She is released from her bindings and led blinking onto a balcony of a dilapidated house where she meets a mysterious Englishman. He treats her kindly, returning her things. She goes for her passport but he tells her she won't use that anymore. He holds up a mirror and she sees her beaten face. She barely recognizes herself. 'Say goodbye Aylin' he tells her. 'Let us begin...' What has brought such a woman to this place? That is the question answered by this compelling series. We meet Aylin again, nine months earlier, only this time she is a woman who has everything, a successful architect, deeply in love with her husband, Selim, doting mother to their handsome son Ömer. She drops Selim off at the airport one morning and everything changes. His plane crashes. There are no survivors. After days of overwhelming grief comes a glimmer of hope: the airline realizes his name was not on the passenger list. Wherever he is, he is not dead - he never boarded the plane. And so Aylin is thrust into a web of shattered illusions, mistrust and fear. Selim's disappearance sets a complex chain of events in motion, events that have their roots many years ago. As Aylin finds strength to cope with the lies she sees in the eyes of all around her, other pieces of the puzzle close in on her. This is not just a story of broken hearts and friendships, but a gripping thriller about the workings of fate, history and our all-too-human hearts. The End.

547,Elif,2014,2019,945,5,"Little girl Elif lives with his mother Melek, stepfather Veysel, her step-sister Zeynep and step-brother Murat. Elif is almost 5 years old but she is much more mature than her peers. She is very helpful and at the same time, strong enough to endure her stepfather's cruelty. Veysel is a hopeless, violent gambler who tortures not only Melek but also little Elif. He plans to sell Elif to pay back his gambling debts. Out of pure coincidence, Melek discovers his husband's ill intention and finds out the passport on behalf of her daughter. In order to save her daughter, she eventually decides to call her long-lasting friend Ayse and asks for her assistance. Ayse is a servant in the house of the wealthy Emiroglu family where Melek used to work. When Ayse arrives at Melek's house, she is so surprised to see her old friend in a desperate situation. She does not understand why Melek is married to this violent man but eventually, learns the secrets that were buried in the past. While Melek was working as a servant at the house of Emiroglu family, she fell in love with the favorite son of the family, Kenan.

She was asked to write about the Pera Palace on its 130th anniversary in one such briefing. She meets Ahmet, the hotel manager, who familiarizes her with the history of the hotel. Ahmet speaks of the various occurrences that took place 100 years ago as if he were a witness to their history. When rain started pouring heavily, Ahmet invites Esra to stay at the hotel. Before midnight, she finds a key next to her bed and believes that Ahmet left the key to the door of the room where Agatha Christie stayed. Overjoyed with the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Esra enters the room and collapses on the bed with the key in her hand.

Throughout his 46-year reign, his fame as the greatest warrior and ruler of his age spreads both to the East and West. With his companion Pargali Ibrahim, Süleyman achieves great victories, and makes his name known in the Muslim World. Süleyman called Ibrahim his brother, friend and advisor. The television series shows Süleyman's consolidation of his power: Pargali Ibrahim being grand minister of state, reinforcing the rule of law throughout the empire, meeting foreign diplomats, and preparing for military campaigns, all set against the backdrop of the tension between Christian Europe and the Ottoman Empire. The series also focuses on the relationships among the members of the imperial household, especially romantic entanglements and rivalries. The animosity between Hürrem Sultan and Mahidevran Sultan, mother of the Sultan's eldest son, and the role of Hafsa Sultan, the valide sultan; Hürrem's rise as Süleyman's favorite while pregnant with his son, her falling from favor several times and her eventual return to grace; Pargali Ibrahim's entanglement with Hatice Sultan, the Sultan's sister, and many others.",tt1848220,"['Halit Ergenç', 'Nur Fettahoglu', 'Selim Bayraktar']",['Turkey'],['Turkish'],['TIMS Productions'],"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']",TVSeries,"['1+1', '2BE', 'ANT1', 'ANTV', 'ATV']",5400,2011-01-05,"From 1520, follows Suleiman the Magnificent and his relatives from his great conquests to the ''Battle of Szigeth''.","[{'actor': 'Halit Ergenç', 'character': 'Kanuni Sultan Süleyman 139 episodes, 2011-2014'}, {'actor': 'Nur Fettahoglu', 'character': 'Mahidevran Sultan 139 episodes, 2011-2014'}, {'actor': 'Selim Bayraktar', 'character': 'Sümbül Aga 139 episodes, 2011-2014'}, {'actor': 'Selen Öztürk', 'character': 'Gülfem Hatun 139 episodes, 2011-2014'}, {'actor': 'Selma Ergeç', 'character': 'Hatice Sultan 102 episodes, 2011-2013'}, {'actor': 'Meryem Uzerli', 'character': 'Hürrem Sultan 100 episodes, 2011-2013'}, {'actor': 'Filiz Ahmet', 'character': 'Nigar Kalfa 100 episodes, 2011-2013'}, {'actor': 'Mehmet Günsür', 'character': 'Sehzade Mustafa 100 episodes, 2011-2014'}, {'actor': 'Pinar Caglar Genctürk', 'character': 'Beyhan 96 episodes, 2011-2013'}, {'actor': 'Pelin Karahan', 'character': 'Mihrimah Sultan 76 episodes, 2012-2014'}, {'actor': 'Gökhan Atalay', 'character': 'Ulama Pasa 76 episodes, 2012-2014'}, {'actor': 'Ubeyd Unal', 'character': 'Muhzir Cavus 76 episodes, 2012-2014'}, {'actor': 'Nihan Büyükagaç', 'character': 'Gülsah Hatun 75 episodes, 2011-2013'}, {'actor': 'Okan Yalabik', 'character': 'Pargali Ibrahim Pasa 71 episodes, 2011-2012'}, {'actor': 'Sabina Ajrula', 'character': 'Afife Hatun 68 episodes, 2012-2014'}]","['Durul Taylan,Yagmur Taylan,Yagiz Alp Akaydin,Mert Baykal']","['Yilmaz Sahin,Atasay Koç,Meral Okay,Ceylan Güleç']","['Nermin Eroglu,Timur Savci,Sevket Cihad Figen']","['Soner Akalin,Fahir Atakoglu,Aytekin Atas']",2011,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
732,Behzat Ç.: Bir Ankara Polisiyesi,2010,2019,105,4,"Derived from the Turkish writer Emrah Serbes's novels ""Behzat Ç: Her Temas Iz Birakir"" (2006) and ""Behzat Ç: Son Hafriyat"" (2010), the series tell the story of Chief Inspector Behzat Ç, leading the Homicide and Vice divisions of the Ankara Police Force. Struggling with a failed marriage, a dark past, a rebellious daughter and corrupt bureaucrats and police officers, Behzat Ç disregards procedure, political correctness and etiquette to pursue and arrest serial killers, hitmen and violent criminals. His underlings from the Homicide and Vice desk aid and assist him in this struggle: the hot tempered, headstrong Harun, the streetwise Hayalet (the ""Ghost""), the self-trained forensics expert Akbaba (the ""Vulture""), the naive and green Cevdet, and Selim and Eda, who try to maintain a healthy relationship amongst the toil and trouble of dealing with murder every day.

739,Ezel,2009,2011,71,2,"Omer is a young man, full of beauty and good spirit. He has just returned from military service and is about to marry the girl of his dreams, the stunning Eysan. His two best friends, Cengiz and Ali are like brothers to him, and he trusts them with all his heart. Everything seems perfect, as his whole life lies in front of him. The drama starts when the police storm into Omer's bedroom when he is still sleeping. He gets arrested for a murder and robbery at the casino the night before. Omer gets imprisoned for the crime - his life is shattered, friends and fiancé disappear. Instead, one single question is on his mind for the next ten years: Why? It is obvious that Omer has been set up, but could such a terrible crime really have been planned by his two best friends and fiancé Eysan? Omer gets eventually declared dead in prison, but the death is a cover up for the revenge to come. After plastic surgery Omer returns as Ezel, with only one mission in life - to find an explanation, and to take everything away from those who once destroyed his life. But first, he has to kill the constant, incorrigible, and endless love he still carries for the girl of his dreams, Eysan. One by one, the pieces fall in place in a very thrilling story. Omer's two best friends Ali and Cengiz were convinced to rob the casino by the mafioso Serdar Tezcan , who also happens to be Omer's girlfriend Eysan's father. Serdar created the whole plan. He needed four people for a successful robbery. The first, Cengiz would be the mole who was working in the casino and who would therefore gain access. The second, Ali would be the ruthless killer who has no problem committing murder if needed. The third, Eysan would be the skilled con-woman who would manipulate the characters. Finally, Omer would be blamed for the robbery by way of implanting false evidence, and therefore misleading the police and causing them to cease all other investigations. Eysan would later testify in court in order to re-establish the evidence and accusations, thus cementing her betrayal. The plan worked successfully and while all 4 got away with millions of dollars' worth of money, Omer went to jail the day after he proposed to Eysan.

Although Agâh lost his wife years ago and he lives in one of the apartments in the building he owns, he is both respected and loved by those who are near him. However, Agah will change his life fundamentally with the news he learns from his doctor. And when his daughter and grandson who live abroad come to live with him the tranquility of his life will be lost completely.
