Esra, a journalist and an avid reader of Agatha Christie novels (as she mentions in every possible conversation), wants to write about various global concerns, but her editor forces her to stick to the click-bait. She was asked to write about the Pera Palace on its 130th anniversary in one such briefing. She meets Ahmet, the hotel manager, who familiarizes her with the history of the hotel. Ahmet speaks of the various occurrences that took place 100 years ago as if he were a witness to their history. When rain started pouring heavily, Ahmet invites Esra to stay at the hotel. Before midnight, she finds a key next to her bed and believes that Ahmet left the key to the door of the room where Agatha Christie stayed. Overjoyed with the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Esra enters the room and collapses on the bed with the key in her hand. Just as the clock strikes 12, there's an sudden earthquake and Esra is transported to a different era.

Although Agâh lost his wife years ago and he lives in one of the apartments in the building he owns, he is both respected and loved by those who are near him. However, Agah will change his life fundamentally with the news he learns from his doctor.
